# Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Activity in Ontario: An Interactive Visualization

This project explores greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Ontario, focusing on the primary sources and regions contributing to these emissions. The interactive visualization allows users to delve into the data to uncover trends, identify major polluters, and understand the spatial distribution of emissions across Ontario.

GHG emissions significantly impact public health, the environment, and the economy. By visualizing this data, our project aims to empower Ontario's citizens, encourage industry accountability, and inform policymakers about areas needing intervention. Understanding these emissions is crucial for addressing climate change and its associated challenges.

## Technologies Used
Tableau: For creating interactive dashboards with maps, charts, and other data visualization tools.
Python: Used for data cleaning and web scraping (Requests library).
Excel: For additional data cleaning and preparation.
R (tidyverse): For data manipulation and analysis.
Google Maps API: To source coordinates for facilities in the dataset.
Canadian Government Resources: For NAICS code industry classifications.

## Dataset
The dataset utilized in this project comes from The Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks, detailing data from regulated facilities under Ontario Regulation 390/18, part of the Environmental Protection Act. It includes facility names, owners, and information about various greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. Total CO2e from all sources in CO2e is used to determine the answers to our research questions.
