# Visualizing-Greenhouse-Gas-Activity-
Overview: Collaborated with a team of 4 to build an Interactive Tableau dashboard visualizing air pollution in Ontario. 

** I worked on the data cleaning and preparation and adding interactivity to the Tableau dashboard. Specifically, I contributed to the filters allowing the user to select specific regions, companies and industries in Ontario + the time slider that allows the user to see pollution trends over time.**

# Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Activity in Ontario: An Interactive Visualization

This project explores greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Ontario, focusing on the primary sources and regions contributing to these emissions. The interactive visualization allows users to delve into the data to uncover trends, identify major polluters, and understand the spatial distribution of emissions across Ontario.

GHG emissions significantly impact public health, the environment, and the economy. By visualizing this data, our project aims to empower Ontario's citizens, encourage industry accountability, and inform policymakers about areas needing intervention. Understanding these emissions is crucial for addressing climate change and its associated challenges.

## Technologies Used
1. Tableau: For creating interactive dashboards with maps, charts, and other data visualization tools.
2. Python: Used for data cleaning and web scraping (Requests library).
3. Excel: For additional data cleaning and preparation.
4. R (tidyverse): For data manipulation and analysis.
5. Google Maps API: To source coordinates for facilities in the dataset.


## Dataset
The dataset utilized in this project comes from The Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks, detailing data from regulated facilities under Ontario Regulation 390/18, part of the Environmental Protection Act. It includes facility names, owners, and information about various greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. Total CO2e from all sources in CO2e is used to determine the answers to our research questions.
